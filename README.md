A busy airport, unpredictable planes, a random weather generator and a mad scientist! What will happen? 

to find out, fork this repo and do

rspec

at command prompt

TODO (questions to ponder): 
1. Add a task force to fight the mad scientist
2. Figure out how to isolate Plane class so Airport isn't dependent on it. (make it a module?)
3. Make Planes change statuses and know what status they are about to adopt. (Plane.taking_off becomes Plane.flying and Plane.landing becomes Plane.landed unless something stops it mid-transition)
4. Add capacity for the airport and runway
5. Add more evil deeds for the Mad Scientist (A bermuda triangle that he can send planes to when someone tries to stop him from changing the weather)
